AMP stands for Accelerated Mobile Pages. How does that concern you? Well, web pages and ads using the AMP format have a significantly higher performance and engagement rate than normal – they load nearly instantly, giving the user a much smoother experience. If your site takes a long time to load, no matter the quality of your content, most people will leave the page before they even see it.

Our list has all the resources you need to introduce yourself to a new world of AMP. You will learn how to publish AMPs – there are a few things you need to watch out for – and you will get guides specifically tailored to creating e-commerce webpages with AMP.

Moreover, our list contains resources on “Instant Articles”. These are exactly what they sound like. They are the new way to publish fast, interactive stories. All you need are the following: A website or blog, access to their HTML Code, your publication’s logo, a Facebook page and a little bit of technical know-how. We think you’ve got what it takes in spades. Do not let this opportunity go to waste.
