If you have not yet gone far in your SEO educational journey, you might find the term “rich snippets” vague. Let us explain what it is and why it is really important for you. A snippet is a result your search engine shows you after you have used it to search for something. In Google, a normal snippet shows the title in blue, the URL in green and a short description of what the page is all about.

A rich snippet is a whole other level than ordinary snippets. Extra information is shown between the URL and the description – things like ratings, votes, pictures, and details of what the page is about, like calories in case it is a recipe. To make it as simple as possible: People like rich snippets.

They have higher CTR(click-through rate) than normal – in other words, you will get much more traffic due to them. This works even if your search engine position remains the same. So how do you get them? By adding structured data markup to your website. And how exactly do you learn how to do that? By going through our rich snippets tools list.
